    <h1>Brain Tumor Detection</h1>
    <p>I built a deep learning model to classify brain tumors on MRI scans. By achieving high accuracy (up to 99%) and
        visualizing results with Grad-CAM, this project demonstrates how AI can contribute to early detection and diagnosis
        in healthcare. This project can assists neurologist in real life.
