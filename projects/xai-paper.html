    <h1>XAI Research Paper</h1>
    <p>
        I did research on Explainable Artifical Intelligence (XAI). Concret on methods to make advanced AI models more
        transparent and understandable. As AI models became too complex for
        humans to comprehend, it is essential that we remain having trust in these models. My study compares two key
        techniques (LIME & GradCAM) for explaining how Deep Convolutional Neural Networks form decisions. <a href="../src/paper-tombackert.pdf" target=" _blank">Here is my paper.</a>
